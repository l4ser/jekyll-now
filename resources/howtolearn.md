So you want to learn to play CTF... There is no secret book or magic bullet to
make you good at it. The only way to improve and be better is to practice (and
study).

Have a look [here]({{ site.baseurl }}/resources/) to learn more about CTFs. You
can also find some links to good resources. What is the subject you are more
interested in? Crypto? Web? Reverse?

You can also find links to wargames and challenges.

Look at past CTFs challenges, try to solve them. Having an hard time with some
of these challenges? Try again and again.

Still no luck? Come at LaSER and we can have fun together trying to solve it :)
